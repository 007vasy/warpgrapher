# Warpgrapher CRUD API

One of the primary features of Warpgrapher is the auto-generation of CRUD operations for all Types. This includes basic and advanced queries that support nested operations and graph traversals. 

Warpgrapher automatically creates a set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each Type and each rel in a Type. This page describes the format of those automatically generated GraphQL operations.
